# Find the right flight with Airport booker

Ready for using app, just fill DB with your own data (By default I created seed file)

# Brief

The home page is landing, you can see all flights sorted by date of arriving and search form for selecting needed one. Drop-down list boxes content built with information from DB. 
After clicking the search button you will see the page with the parameters of the requested flight and the list of available flights. After you chose the flight and clicked book button, you'll see the page with forms for adding passanger. Their number depends on selected 'Number of passengers' field.
